With the demands of regular school curriculum, hectic schedules, and the hustle and bustle of family life, it can be difficult to find flexibility in a supplemental educational program that allows your student to flourish. Through offering classes at convenient times for busy families (after-school and evenings), your child can get the instruction they need to increase their math skills and confidence. At 98th Percentile, we strive to instill the important concepts and skills required for command of the mathematics standards. We closely monitor each student’s learning progress and customize lessons specific to their unique needs. 98th Percentile provides the thoroughness of an all-inclusive math program all from the comfort of your home.

Take our free online placement test to see where your child’s math levels are and speak with a specialist to enroll them in a promotional class today!

What Our Math Program Offers
Personalized Attention
Small class sized with a maximum of 4 students allow teachers to pay individual attention to each student, demonstrate math concepts in language your child will understand, guide students through practice questions and clarify all questions. As each student progresses through class, teachers are able to customize lessons specific to each student of the skills they need to practice in order to achieve mastery.

Comprehensive Curriculum
Our curriculum centers around national Common Core standards, and your child will receive instruction through every single topic. Every one of our lessons have been individually crafted through 98th Percentile’s curriculum team incorporating a variety of well-respected teaching methodologies. Our curriculum has been developed with the success of each student in mind.

Data-Driven Results
Our students, on average, complete a grade level in our program in 6 months. We constantly refer to data collected by teachers based on assessments and observation to gauge each individual student’s progress and promote them when they have reached a determined threshold. This system ensures that students achieve not only proficiency, but mastery in every math skill and concept before advancing them to the next grade level.

About The Program
Math is a foundational subject that all students need command of as they grow into adults. Math is something we use every day, and a strong proficiency is an excellent prerequisite to future successes. As math classes focus on operations and algebraic thinking, operations in base 10, fractions, measurement and data, and geometry, the student will develop a strong foundation to promote academic success.
The math program at 98th Percentile is a unique blend of online learning experiences and traditional live classroom teaching. The format allows students to engage with their teacher and fellow students from virtually anywhere – all that is required is a device with internet access. The pedagogical methods that support the curriculum are research-backed and proven to be successful. Our comprehensive program stands unique among other available platforms.
Our math program is customized to teach your child’s entire grade level in 6 months. The program is aligned with common core standards, and requires two 50-minute sessions per week, followed by 20-30 minutes of additional independent practice per day.


Methodology
Coding
Student-Centered Approach
Teachers and students both play an active role in the learning process. The teacher facilitates comprehension of the material while constantly and actively measuring student learning. Students are engaged and involved during the entire class session where the teacher gauges their understanding through questions and discussions, and then the student demonstrates their mastery through independent practice.

Coding
Differentiated Instruction
Our program is designed to meet individual student needs by maintaining small classes, no more than 4 to a class. While the bulk of each session focuses on a specific concept or skill, time is allotted to address individual skill gaps and lessons are provided as necessary. This is to ensure no skill goes unaddressed as your student advances to the next grade level.

Coding
High-Tech Approach to Learning
Technology plays a massive role in our program, as we are 100% online. Through integrating traditional teaching methods by using devices, applications, and the internet, students are able to connect with committed teachers and peers from around the country to engage in material and learn.

Benefit
Coding
Individualized Schedule
Choose a day and time that fits with your family’s schedule for your child to engage in a 50-minute class to focus and learn. By students taking class in their own environment, the distractions and obstacles to learning that may be present in traditional extra-curricular or after school academic programs are absent. This provides students a strong foundation to grow in their education.

Coding
Increase Proficiencies
As our teachers focus more attention on your child, they tailor lessons that will fill in any gaps from previous school years and ensure that they are on-track to complete their grade level on time. This also translates to success in their traditional classrooms, as they can apply the skills they learn at 98th Percentile to their everyday schooling.

Coding
Fun, Engaging Content
Students learn best when they are engaged. Our lessons include real-life examples to teach concepts that can readily be applied to their everyday lives. Plus, the way our classes are structured provide students with the opportunity to engage in discussion with their peers from around the country to deepen their understanding while improving their communication skills.

Coding
Committed Teachers
Our teachers reside in both America (English classes) and India (Math &amp; Coding classes), have teaching valid credentials and classroom experience. They implement effective teaching strategies, care about the growth and progress of their students, and are devoted professionals who strive to keep students constantly engaged and in learning mode.
